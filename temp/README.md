## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how 


## Table of Contents

```md
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project
```

## Installation

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions

```

## Usage

Here are some guidelines to help you get started:

* Create a `.gitignore` file and include `node_modules/` and `.DS_Store/` so that your `node_modules` directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your `.gitignore` file before installing any npm dependencies.

* Make sure that your repo includes a `package.json` with the required dependencies. You can create one by running `npm init` when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.


## Contributing

This homework is graded based on the following criteria: 


## Tests

* A sample README generated using the application must be submitted.

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.


## Questions

* A sample README generated using the application must be submitted.

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.
